# User-interface for modifying a series of tasks
Utilized flow control to create a user interface with 7 different options for modifying a series of tasks.
Wrote over 25 functions to allow the user to perform actions such as adding tasks, deleting tasks, saving as CSV, and quitting the module.
Used containers to store data (e.g., number of days in each month and status/priority of a task).
